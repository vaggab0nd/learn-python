```

## Python Environment

- **Language**: Python
- **Platform**: Linux
- **Purpose**: Learning and experimentation

## Development Guidelines

### Code Style
- Follow PEP 8 style guidelines for Python code
- Use descriptive variable and function names
- Include docstrings for functions and classes
- Keep functions focused and single-purpose

### Best Practices
- Write clear, readable code optimized for learning
- Add comments to explain complex concepts or logic
- Include examples and test cases where appropriate
- Focus on understanding fundamentals before advanced topics

### Running Python Code
```bash
# Run a Python script
python3 script_name.py

# Or with specific Python version
python script_name.py
```

### Testing
- Consider using pytest for unit tests as the project grows
- Test files should follow the pattern `test_*.py`

## Learning Path Suggestions

When working on this repository:
1. Start with Python fundamentals (variables, data types, control flow)
2. Progress to functions and modules
3. Explore object-oriented programming concepts
4. Learn about file handling and exceptions
5. Experiment with common libraries and frameworks

## Git Workflow

- Development branch: `claude/update-claude-md-9GLDG`
- Commit messages should be clear and descriptive
- Push changes when features or exercises are complete

## Notes for AI Assistants

- Prioritize educational value and code clarity
- Explain concepts thoroughly when introducing new ideas
- Provide examples and encourage experimentation
- Be patient with learning curves and mistakes
- Suggest incremental improvements and learning resources
